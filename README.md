# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Background Color Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior when using Tailwind CSS classes in a flexbox container.  The background colors are not applied as expected.

## Bug Description

When placing divs with background colors within a `flex` container, the background colors are not rendered correctly.  This occurs despite the Tailwind CSS classes being correctly applied, suggesting a conflict between flexbox and background styling in certain cases. 

## Solution

A solution involves specifying a `min-width` or other size properties to ensure the flex items occupy sufficient space. A more robust solution might involve restructuring the HTML to avoid the conflict, or examining the surrounding CSS for potential overrides.
